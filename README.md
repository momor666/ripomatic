Wrapper for HandBrakeCLI to deal with TV series more effectively

### Requirements
Designed to run on Linux.
Requires HandBrakeCLI and lsdvd to be installed.

### Further development

* Some DVD have weird, really long tracks that combine all episodes. Need to set a sane max length based upon estimated episode length e.g short, med, long
* For use with Plex, this would benefit from automatically getting the correct title from theTVdb.com
